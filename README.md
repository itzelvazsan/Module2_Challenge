# Module2_Challenge
By: Itzel Vázquez Sánchez

## Project Description

This projects shows a code to identify quarterly price changes and Total Volume of Stocks Bought form a set of Ticker Stocks. The Excel file had 4 Worksheets, each for a quarter of the year. It also had the information in the columns: 
<ticker>	<date>	<open>	<high>	<low>	<close>	<vol>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36ad44d8-ef10-404e-9cdf-41b9c66c5f6b)

The Challenge instructions asked to find:
* Ticker Name
* Quarterly Change
* Percent Change
* Total Stock Volume

That information must be in a Summary Table, like this:

It was necesary to identify:
* Greatest % Increase and Ticker
* Greatest % Decrease and Ticker
* Greatest Volume and Ticker

That information should look like this:

The code showed in this Project allows to do the aforementioned tasks and loops succesfully through the four worksheets.

This Project is the result of the learning lessons of VBA Module (Module 2) from the Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp 2024. The main goal is to use the acquired habilities and knowledge in a real case.

The code of this project origins from the excercises worked in the Zoom Lessons of the Boot Camp and the Solved versions of the code. I also used help from Stackoverflow and Learn Microsoft:
